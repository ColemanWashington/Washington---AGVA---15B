            <h3>
      What To Start Out With
    </h3>
    <p>
        There are mutiple of different things that you should start off with,
        but there is somethings that I recommend.
    </p>
    <!-- here I added a different, but bolded paragraph to help prepare the readers for the incoming list down below -->
    <p><b>You should have ready:</b></p>
    <ul style="list-style-type:square">
      <li>
        A 3d modelling website 
      </li>
      <!-- I also added a list to tell everyone the things they will be needing for the 3d printing so they wouldn't get confused -->
      </ul>
        <p>
          <!-- I added a link for people so they wouldn't have to type it in their search bar and go searhing for it so all they would have to do is click
          I also added the target attribute so it would open a page to the right of the one you are currently view this one on-->
          <!-- I also added Italics around the link so that it would be easier for the reader to look at it and know it was a link-->
          For beginners I suggest <i><a href="https://www.tinkercad.com" target="_blank">tinkercad.com</a></i>
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
      <li>
        A folder ready - optional
      </li>
      <li>
        a website for changing the code
      </li>
      </ul>
        <p>
          It is just helpful to be able to set the correct settings so that the print won't be messy or mess up when you run it on the printer.
          Also you want to convert the file type to .gcode
        </p>
            <p>
      If you are using Tinkercad then that's 
      good, because tinkercad gives you a wide variety 
      of blocks to work with and it basically set up for the 
      use of begginers. If you have used a 3d moddeling software before
      and prefer to use it then thats good too. 
    </p>
    <h3>
      How To Export the file Into a 3D Printer Software
    </h3>
    <!-- below I added quotes, and some quotes have boldness to reference back to a website and how it would look  -->
    <p>
      So after you have finally finished with making the thing you wanted to 3d print in tinkercad, or the editor software you used,
      you would want to find somewhere on the screen that says <b><q>export</q></b>. For tinkercad that would be in the top right. 
      <!-- I added the target="_blank" attribute so that the link would open to a different tab to the right of the one you are viewing this code on. -->
      <!-- I also added Italics around the link so that it would be easier for the reader to look at it and know it was a link-->
      After you have exported your file you would want to go over to the software <i><a href="https://grid.space/kiri/" target="_blank">kiri:moto</a></i>.
      Like before that was just a suggestion from me, but you can go to one that you are familiar with.
      Once you are in kiri:moto, you would want to change your printer type to the printer you have, or are going to use. 
      The way to do this in <b>kiri:moto</b> is by heading to the <q>gear icon</q> in the top right, then click on <q>machines</q> go the the drop down menu next to <q>select device</q>,
      then search for your device. After you have done so you would want to change the settings on the left side.</p>
       <p>
         <!-- here I added a different, but bolded paragraph to help prepare the readers for the incoming list down below -->
         <b>Change the following:</b>
    </p>
    <!-- I added yet another list so that they would be referencing to the side panel in kiri:moto -->
    <ul style="list-style-type:square">
      <li>
        Base
      </li>
      <li>
        Cooling
      </li>
      <li>
        Sparse Fill
      </li>
      <li>
        Output
      </li>
      <li>
        Expert
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>After you have edited all of those to the best setting they have, make sure you look them up, you would want to finally export it</p>
            <h3>
      Sending the File to the Printer
    </h3>
    <p>
      To send the file that you finally exported to the printer, you would want
      to take the .gcode file and put it into a folder. You are putting them into folders so you can 
      group all of your codes together so you won't just go looking everywhere for the file, and eventually 
      giving up and re-exporting the file. Once you have succesfully put the file into the folder you would want to get your USB drive 
      that was listed before so you would be able to put the file in there. So you would want to plug your USB drive in the USB slot and locate it in the files app.
      Open the folder in that you put your file in, and then drag and drop it into the usb slot.
      After you have dropped it in the USB, eject the USB by clicking the eject button.
      Finally plug the USB into the pinter and start printing it.
      Make sure you check on it every hour if it has a long print session.

      Conclusion
    </h2>
    <p>
      You have officially learned the steps to 3D Printing, you obviously had to learn some things by yourself
      since I wasn't able to fully help you with everything since I am on a time limit. I hope this has helped you,
      and I can't wait to see some awsome inventions you all will late make. I hope I did a did job explaining what
